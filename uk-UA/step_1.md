### Scratch coordinates

+ In Scratch, the coordinates `x:0, y:0` mark the central position on the Stage.

A position like `x:-200, y:-100` is towards the bottom left on the Stage, and a position like `x:200, y:100` is near the top right.

+ You can see this for yourself by adding the **Xy-grid** backdrop to your project.
